The duke, who was thus driven from his dominions, retired with a few 
faithful followers to the forest of Arden; and here the good duke 
lived with his loving friends, who had put themselves into a 
voluntary exile for his sake, while their land and revenues enriched 
the false usurper; and custom soon made the life of careless ease they 
led here more sweet to them than the pomp and uneasy splendour of a 
courtier's life.
